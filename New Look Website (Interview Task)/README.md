# New Look Website

For an interview at New Look I was given the following task to complete in the space of a week:

Using the array create a carousel that displays all the items. It is up to you to what you chose to display for each item i.e image, title and price or image and price.
You have to apply three filters to the carousel:

- Search filter that creates and returns an array of items/item that matches the input to the productTitle.
- Price range that creates and returns an array of items that fall in between the range.
 -Product type i.e jeans, jackets-coats – there is not a property provided for this but take a look at the productUrls to help with this.
 -If you click on one of the items it should open up a popup with information about the product with a link to the product.

The title and subtitle are provided below. 

Title – ‘Chosen for you’
Subtitle – ‘We think you will love these’
