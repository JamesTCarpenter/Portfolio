# Draw App

Task:

A drawing app for browsers that I created using HTML, JavaScript and p5.js.

This was a task that was given to me in my Introduction to Programming 2 module at Goldsmiths University. I had creative freedom when designing the functionailty that the draw app provides.

I chose to implement the following features: 

- colour palette
- eraser tool
- freehand tool
- line tool
- mirror tool
- spray can tool
- stamp tool
