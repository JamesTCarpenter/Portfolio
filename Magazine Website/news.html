            <h2> Landlord Are Cutting Rent In Major Cities By Up To 20% Due To Pandemic</h2>
            <h5>(17th September 2020)</h5>
            <p> There seems to be a lot of negatives to 2020 so far but things could be looking up for people wanting to rent in major cities in the UK
            <br><br>
            The reason behind this major change in the housing ecomony is due to the fact that tenants want to escape from the busy city atmosphere in hopes this reduces their risk of catching COVID. They have been noted to be relocate to bigger properties in more rural parts of the country and as a result has seen the market in metropolitan areas reduce drastically. Another major reason is the number of international students has decreased rapidly since the start of the pandemic.
            <br><br>
            This might be a blessing in disguise for new renters who want to live in an area that is usually out of budget for them.

            <h2> Will Working From Home Be The New Normal After Lockdown Is Over?</h2>
            <h5>(12th September 2020)</h5>
            <p> Over the past couple of months the way we have been working has been changing, but could this be a permanent fixture?
            <br><br>
            I can vouch for a number of people when I say that working from home took some getting use to. The comfort of your own home seems like a good environment at first but it is riddled with distractions and took a number of weeks to get into a good routine. Now it seems however, that this short term change that we took could be perminent for some people.
            <br><br>
            Many companies across the UK are deciding to make the change to working from home permanent for some jobs as the benefits seem to outweight the negatives. From a business perspective, working from home means the reduction in costs for office space, electricity, food and drink, and expenses used up by employees. In some cases, the use of new video technology such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams has given companies a new look into what the future holds and possibly a revamp in how we work together in our day to day lives.

            <h2> Instagram Is Now 10 Years Old, But Has It Had A Positive Or Negative Impact On Us? </h2>
            <h5>(12th September 2020)</h5>
            <p> 10 years seems like a milestone to celebrate but is this social media app really giving us enjoyment?
            <br><br>
            The concept is simple, post a picture or video, add a caption, and post it for all your friends and followers to see. It sounds pretty similar to most other social media apps but is sharing photos actually affecting our mental health? I suppose its who you follow and how you use the app. There is no harm is posting updates and commenting and sharing things between friends, and in some cases, it is a good way to interact with people in which accessibility is hard so having this outlet is beneficial.
            <br><br>
            However, there is a subtle dark side to the app. It seems more and more people are posting pictures that persuade us of a false reality hidden behind filters and camera angles. This seems to be endorsed by certain celebrities and is directly affecting the metal health of younger people who believe that their is a new standard that they cannot reach. Does this mean that we need to address this and educate people of the truth behind the lies, or do we directly report the users who post these images and videos? 
            <br><br>
            Either way, there are both ups and downs of the app, and hopefully in the next 10 years we will see there being more positives than negatives.

            <h2> Labour Suggests Phase Out Of Petrol Cars By 2030 </h2>
            <h5>(12th September 2020)</h5>
            <p> Global warming is a big issue, especially in big cities. It seems like Labour are trying to help takle this by speeding up deadlines
            <br><br>
            We all know that there are many things that are affecting the environment. Deforestation, the meat industry and air pollution to name a few. It seems like Labour are looking to deal with the latter by suggesting that we scrap petrol cars by 2030. This comes as it seems as if the UK is falling behind compared to other countries who are already working towards better alternatives.
            <br><br>
            Currently, the number of electric cars and other vehicles on the road is small, but has seen a massive increase over the last 10 years due to a push in eco friendly cars by big car maufacturers. Also a lot of money has been put into providing electric cars with charging stations over all areas of the UK. This in tern with Labours announcement could mean that we take a big step forward in providing cleaner air and reducing the number of fossil fuels being burnt.
