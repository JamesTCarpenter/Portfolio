# Magazine Website

Task:

A simple online magazine website with 3 pages to show range of html and css skills.

This was a task that was given to me in my Web Development module at Goldsmiths University. I was given creative freedom to create a website using the skills I had learn so far. I decided to create an online magazine that was focused on young students.

I chose to incorperate a section for music, sport, fashion and news on the website to appeal to a wide demographic.
