            <h2>Single Review: Stormzy - Superheroes</h2>
            <p>Trying to follow up on an amazing first album is a tough trait for any musician, but for an artist like Stormzy it is the make or break of his career. In 2017 we were gifted with the debut album Gang Signs and Prayers which seemed to blend a mix of harcore grime and soft gospel-esque singles. After listening to Superheroes I feel as though he successfully mixed the two.
            <br><br>
            The message here is one of inspiration and love to the Black British youth and, as well as being uplifting and powerful, it is also one of his best songs to date. The beat feels nostalgic and the lyrics really put an emphasis of loving who you are and the heritage you came from. There are numerous references to influencial black artists who have excelled in their field such as the author Mallory Blackman, musicians Dave, Nina Simone and comedian Michael Dapaah that help to bring this message in full circle. 
            <br><br>
            On a hugely successful second album, this single stands out as one of the highlights of an artist who can really inspire the future generation.

            <h2>New Music Video For "Really Gotta Go" By VIXANS </h2>
            <p>After releasing two singles at the beginning of the year, VIXANS have released their new song Really Gotta Go with an accompanying music video.
            <br><br>
            The video encorperates everything we know about the band so far, they focus on playing the music the way they want and it is up to the listener if they follow them for the ride or not. The music video mirrors this with a simple recording of the song in what seems to be filmed in a standard rehersal room with the story being told in the music. No fancy sets or clever camera work has gone into the video, just a raw performance featuring the three band members. 
            <br><br>
            The simplicity actually makes the song stand out more and we can't wait to see whats in store for them in the coming months.

            <h2>New Lockdown Rules Mean The Closure of Newcastle's Virgin Money Arena Social Distance Shows</h2>
            <p> Just as we started to see normality rear its head in the easing of luckdown, tragedy has struck again for music fans
            <br><br>
            In the last few weeks there were a number of artists performing in the newly built Virgin Money Arena that was created to allow music fans to see their favourite artists live while still following the COVID lockdown rules. The reviews from the gigs were positive and it seemed as though this could be the new way to get our dose of music through the forseeable future until the pandemic died down.
            <br><br>
            However, due to new lockdown rules in the north of England, these remaining gigs have had to be cancelled and the future of the venue is uncertain. Artists such as Chase and Staus and Kaiser Cheifs were set to play this weekend before the ruling. 
            <br><br>
            Here's to hoping a new solution comes out soon.
