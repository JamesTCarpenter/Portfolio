            <h2> Clippers Get Knocked Out By Nuggets After Turnaround From 3-1 Game Handicap</h2>
            <h5>(17th September 2020)</h5>
            <p> The Los Angeles Clippers seemed to be guarenteed a semi-final place in what looked like a clean sweep to Denver Nuggets, unfortuantely things didn't run so smoothly...
            <br><br>
            The Clippers haven't always been the best of teams but it seems like things could have changed this season with the new additions of last years NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and All Star player Paul George. Coming into the quarter finals it looked like the Clippers had secured the victory being 3-1 up against the Denver Nuggets. Unfortuantely things took a turn when the Nuggets won two straight games, leading it to a 3-3 tie and bringing it down to the Game 7 decider.
            <br><br>
            The pressure of getting one last win seemed to cause trouble for the Clippers and having the Nuggets on a two game win streak proved to be the end factor. Out of all of the 7 games the final match had the biggest point difference with the score being 104-89. There is a lot of room for improvement on the team and the coaches will be trying to figure out what went wrong for what should of been a sure fire victory.

            <h2> Leeds First Game In the Premier League Seems To Predict A Good Season Position After Close 4-3 Loss to Champions Liverpool</h2>
            <h5>(12th September 2020)</h5>
            <p>Although their first game of the season ended in a loss for newly promoted Leeds United, the performance and close score line to last years champions Liverpool has given fans high hopes for the team.
            <br><br>
            It always seems to be the case that the newly promoted teams either fail miserably or are outstanding in their first year in the division. Sheffield United are a good example of when this goes well and Norwich are an example of when it doesn't. Leeds however seemed to go into their first game of the season against the raining champions Liverpool with a point to prove. 
            <br><br>
            The game started with a goal in the 4th minute from Mohamed Salah, and at that point we thought it would be a straight forward win for Liverpool, but then JAck Harrison make a comeback 8 minutes later. This then went back and forth with the teams trying to once up the other with an equal scoreline. Unfortunatley Salah scored a final goal in the 88th minute but we were on edge until the very end.
            <br><br>
            I defintely believe that Leeds might be the dark horse of this season, but only time will tell.

            <h2> Will Tom Brady Be Able To Get Tampa Bay A Championship After 18 Years Of Misfortune? </h2>
            <h5>(12th September 2020)</h5>
            <p>Having joined the Buccaneers this season after spending 19 years being a dominant player and winning six championships with the New England Patriots, will success be the same after a fresh start?
            <br><br>
            You don't have to know a lot about american football to know who Tom Brady is. He is the NFL equivalent to some of the greats in other sports such as Ronaldo, Michael Jordan, Serena Williams or Tiger Woods. The reason he is so well known is because he has won the Super Bowl 6 times while on the team the New England Patriots. Winning 6 makes him one of a few players to have won the most Championship rings in the entirety of the game, and it seems he is looking to win more by moving to a new team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
            <br><br>
            This is a bold move for the player as the Buccaneers aren't know to be the best team in the division. In fact they have only ever won one championship back in 2002 and haven't even made the playoof's since 2007. I can see the appeal for Brady as I am sure he wants to prove that he can carry a team to a championship win, therefore increasing his legendary status, but maybe this is a move that will see more misappointments than rewards
