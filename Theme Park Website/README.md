Task:

A simple theme park website with 3 pages to show range of html and css skills.

This was a task that was given to me in my Web Development module at Goldsmiths University. I was put in a group of 4 and collectively we had to create a theme park website that was tailored to a certain demographic.

We chose to focus on an environmental park that focused on showing off landmarks from countries around the world.
