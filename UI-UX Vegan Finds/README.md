# Vegan Finds UI/UX

Task: 

This was a project given to me on my UI/UX Design course by CaLARTS University. The objectives were as follows:

Page 1: Your product name/title, short description, tagline, and description of the main activity or function of the app from Week 2, revised as necessary. See page 1 of the SeeCells project for an example.

Page 2: Your mood board from Week 2. See page 2 of the SeeCells project for an example. 

Page 3: Your sample pattern library from Week 3. See page 3 of the SeeCells project for an example. 

Page 4: Your two interface sketches. See page 4 of the SeeCells project for an example.
