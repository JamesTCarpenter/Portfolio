# Platformer Game

Task:

A simple platformer game that I created using JavaScript and p5.js.

This was a task that was given to me in my Introduction to Programming module at Goldsmiths University. I had creative freedom when designing the objects in the game.

I chose to create a cyclops character who has a goal of reaching the flag at the end of the level. Along the way there are coins to collect and enemies to avoid. I also implemented a 3 lives system to make the game more challenging.
