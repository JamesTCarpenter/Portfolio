# Hangman Game

Task:

A simple platformer game that I created using Python.

This was a task that was given to me in my Software Technician Apprenticeship. I had creative freedom when designing the game type and style.

I chose to create a text based hangman game that was aimed at children. The theme was to guess farmyard words and the hangman character was styled in the form of an egg either cracking or turning into a chick depending of if the user lost or won.
